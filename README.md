# Zemina-Portfolio

## Description
The webpage I made is my own personal portfolio that I can later add my projects to, so that I can show future employers or to have for myself. On the webpage you can access my work projects, a little about me section and a contact info section. You can navigate to these sections from the navigation links in the header, at the top of the webpage.
To make this I used VS code to code the HTML and CSS.
